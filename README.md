# MSTCN-VAE
Thanks for the great effort contributed by two friends, Wenxuan Yuan and Shanchuan He. In fact, I was the one who added the parameter-research function to the model and debugged the code. But it's still a badge of honor for being a partner within this period of time, which helped me enhance my coding ability.  
If you want to look the way to start it in detail, turning to https://github.com/Wenxuan52/MSTCN-VAE where the original version of this model locates in.  
(PS: I add this hyperparameter research function by changing main.py, mstcn_vae.py and train_rawdata.yaml. For the people who want to extend this function to other network, carefully checking the differences between documents I mentioned above and other similar documents would be of great help. And dont forget processor.py and recognition.py, which are also noteworthy.)
